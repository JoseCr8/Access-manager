# Access manager
This a university project.

The system manages access to a building\s, giving access codes of different types and validating them. To get an access code first you need to ask for it and give a number of credentials, then the system generates a code for each request if approved and stores it on a json, which serves the purpose of a data base.

It's all written in python(3), and the project has a number of unittest to validate the functionality of the modules.
